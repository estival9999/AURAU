# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is the AURALIS system - a sophisticated multi-agent AI architecture for processing and analyzing corporate meeting information. The system features:
- A GUI application for meeting management (interface_1.py)
- A multi-agent system architecture (described in README_SISTEMA_AGENTES_DETALHADO.md)
- Voice recording and transcription capabilities
- AI-powered analysis and brainstorming

## Development Commands

### Running the Application
```bash
python interface_1.py
```

### Dependencies
The project uses:
- customtkinter - Modern GUI framework
- Standard libraries: threading, datetime, math, random, numpy

Note: No requirements.txt file exists yet. Key dependencies that need to be installed:
```bash
pip install customtkinter numpy
```

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Multi-Agent System (src/agentes/)
The system implements a sophisticated agent architecture with:
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Interprets user intentions and delegates to specialized agents
- **Intelligent Query Agent**: Performs semantic search and information retrieval
- **Brainstorm Agent**: Generates creative ideas using techniques like SCAMPER
- **Inter-agent Communication System**: Message bus for asynchronous agent communication
- **Optimization System**: Intelligent caching, context compression, and batch processing

Key design patterns:
- Abstract base class (AgenteBase) for all agents
- Mock implementations for testing without OpenAI API
- Event-driven communication between agents
- LRU cache with TTL for performance optimization

### 2. GUI Application (interface_1.py)
A desktop application with:
- Fixed 320x240 pixel resolution optimized for small screens
- Dark theme with carefully selected color palette
- Multiple screens: Login, Main Menu, Meeting History, Recording, AI Assistant
- Audio interface with real-time particle animations
- State management for navigation and data flow

## Key Technical Details

### Agent System Integration Points
When integrating the agent system with the GUI:
- Initialize `SistemaAgentes` in main.py
- Pass user messages through `processar_mensagem_usuario()`
- Provide context including current meeting info and user data

### GUI State Management
The GUI uses these key state variables:
- `self.usuario_logado`: Current user info
- `self.frame_atual`: Active screen frame
- `self.gravando`: Recording status
- `self.contexto_reuniao`: Meeting context for AI

### Performance Considerations
- Cache hit rate target: ~85%
- Animation refresh rate: 30ms (33 FPS)
- Timer update rate: 100ms
- Maximum simultaneous particles: ~50

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New Agent
1. Create class inheriting from `AgenteBase`
2. Implement `get_prompt_sistema()` and `processar_mensagem()`
3. Register in `sistema_agentes.py`
4. Add to orchestrator's routing map

### Adding a New GUI Screen
1. Create `mostrar_nova_tela()` method
2. Create `_criar_nova_tela()` implementation
3. Use `self.transicao_rapida()` for navigation
4. Include standard header with `self.criar_cabecalho_voltar()`

### Modifying the Color Scheme
Update the color dictionary in `SistemaTFT.__init__()`:
```python
self.cores["nova_cor"] = "#HEXCODE"
```
